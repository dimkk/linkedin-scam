Original readme:

## Getting Started

You must run on the Command Prompt or Terminal(Ubuntu or MacOS), not vs-code terminal.

this project doesn't work well when running on the Vs-code terminal

First, run the development server:
Node version: over 18.19.0, 20.16.0 is better
```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
